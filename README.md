# HerTechHackathon

The project aims to find the closest sefe zone for Women in distress based on her location data captured using GPS.

VijayaNagar to Whitefield is the route in which she is travelling and there are 488 GPS location points along the route 
which is retrieved from http://map.project-osrm.org.

For demonstration purpose Public spots within a radius of 2 km from the given datapoint is created and places 
are rankordered based on Distance, Duration and User Rating. Further, time constraint is applied so that rank order changes if
the women is travelling at night.
